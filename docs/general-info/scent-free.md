# Scent-free Environment
The college is a scent-free environment. 

We have several students and staff members who are sensitive to certain scents causing them physical discomfort.  
We ask that all students and staff refrain from using perfume, cologne, scented hair products, scented deodorant, and heavily scented laundry detergent or fabric softener.  
Students may be asked to leave the campus, to change or to wash off the scent.  
Repeated offenses will result in disciplinary action. 

Students asked to leave the campus will be required to log out of the attendance recorder and log back in upon return to the campus.
