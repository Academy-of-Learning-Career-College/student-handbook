# Study Strategies 

- Study every day.
- Set a definite time limit. The length of time you need for studying depends on you and your goals. No two students are identical.
- Do "One Thing at a Time", that is, either listen OR write OR read, etc. Do not attempt to listen and read OR listen and type at the same time.
- Highlight key sentences and write notes in your books will help you review effectively.
- Review each lesson quickly. Get the overview and then tackle any details and difficulties.
- Review relevant textbook sections or chapter and make use of all other resources available.
- Allow for brief breaks of 5 to 10 minutes if studying for a long period of time.
- Know the examination format â€“ essay questions, short answer, multiple choice, etc.
- Reinforce what you learn in class by:
    - Writing summaries in outline form,
    - Reciting material aloud without referring to notes,
- Telling someone what you have learned,
- Testing your answers with flashcard question and answer items.
- Listen to the Learning Coach's or Instructor's tips on what will be emphasized. Never assume something won't be included on a test or exam unless told so specifically.
