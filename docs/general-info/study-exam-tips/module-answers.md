# Module Answers
At the end of each module/lesson, there are review questions for you to complete. Depends on the course, these questions can be complete on the computer or on the workbook. You are encouraged to complete these questions on your own. They provide you with your first opportunity to assess your level of understanding. Certain courses count these review questions towards your mark for the course.

If these questions are on the computer, you can check the answer keys after completing them. If they are in the workbooks, you can ask the Learning Coaches the location the Answer Binder, which contains the answer keys.

Please refer to the answers and make corrections, re-reading applicable sections if necessary. You will not benefit by merely changing/copying the answers. Please discuss with a Learning Coach to find out the reason.

*Answer keys in the binders cannot be photocopied.*
