# Break Area or Lunchroom
As a result of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, Academy of LearningÂ® Career College no longer provides a lunch area for students. All breaks must be taken outside of the campus.

## Consumption of Food and Beverages
Students may be permitted to have beverages at their workstation; however, we expect care to be taken to avoid spills. All drinks must be kept in a SPILL-PROOF container and are the responsibility of the student. If equipment is damaged due to a spill, the student to whom the beverage belongs, will be held responsible for replacement and/or repair. NO food of any kind is allowed at workstations.
