# Telephone Calls
Students may ask college staff to use the campus telephone. Students may only make urgent calls or calls relating to their job search. Please remember that it is a business line, so kindly limit the duration of your calls.

Due to the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act we are unable to confirm to callers whether a student is at school.

The college will only relay a message in cases of extreme emergency. Please inform the office at the college about any situation where we may be required to relay a message (e.g. serious illness in the family, daycare, etc.)
