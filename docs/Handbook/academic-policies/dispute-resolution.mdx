Dispute Resolution policies are in place for potential student and staff grievances at the college. For either situation, the Franchisor sometimes becomes a neutral mediator.
:::

Grievances by any student that pertains to Academy of Learning® Career College, the Executive Director, any other student, or staff member, will require the following procedure.

1. Initially, students should always try to resolve the issue informally and promptly by taking to the other party involved. If the issue cannot be resolved, the student should schedule a meeting with one of the Executive Director (Alda Messiah) to discuss the situation. The Executive Director will be responsible for making the determination in the respect to the complaint. If the Executive Director is absent or named in the complaint, the Franchisor will then be responsible for deciding in respect of the complaint.

1. Should the student be unable to resolve the grievance satisfactorily, the grievance should be addressed formally, in writing, to an Executive Director (Alda Messiah). Written submission of the grievance should include a detailed and clear description of the grievance and include all relevant information, such as the nature of the problem, date of occurrences(s), and names(s) of parties involved.

1. The Executive Director (Alda Messiah) should then request similar submissions from all other involved parties and should attempt to resolve the grievance within five (5) business days of receipt of all written submissions. The Executive Director should orally communicate a decision then follow with a written decision to the student.

1. If the Executive Director (Alda Messiah) is unable to resolve the grievance, or is the subject of the grievance, the student then may choose to submit the grievance in writing, and including all relevant information and the Executive Director's decision, to the Franchisor at the address below for immediate review:
