# Student Commitment
All students are required to demonstrate a commitment to their studies and to progress at a satisfactory rate. There are minimum standards which all students must meet:

- Meet your minimum weekly hours;
- Complete all assignments, projects, and homework;
- Submit all quizzes, tests, mid-terms and final exams on time;
- Obtain a minimum of 60% in each course; Note: The minimum mark may vary by program.
- Maintain a minimum overall average of 75% in a registered diploma program or registered certificate program; Note: Marks may vary by registered diploma program or registered certificate program
- Obtain a minimum mark of 75% on each individual certificate course.

You can demonstrate commitment in your studies by:

Attending all scheduled classes;

- Coming to class on time;
- Being prepared (homework or reading may be required depending on the program);
- Being an active student, by listening, doing and completing each task assigned;
- Working on assigned work during class time;
- Participating actively (with a good attitude) in labs, classes and clinical placements;
- Remaining in class for the full, scheduled time each day;
- Seeking help when you need it (e.g. academic, financial and budgeting advice and career guidance); 
- Remaining in good academic standing.

These are just a few examples. Should you have any concerns about whether you are meeting your obligations, speak to your Learning Coach, Instructor, or director of the college.
