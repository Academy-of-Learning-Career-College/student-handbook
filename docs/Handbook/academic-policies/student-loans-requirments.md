# Student Aid BC Loan Requirements
To stay eligible for Student Aid BC loans or grants, you must attend school full-time* for the entire study period for which you have received funding.

*Full-time is at least 60% of the full course load (40% for students with permanent disabilities) for at least 12 consecutive weeks. At AOLCC, it translates to minimum weekly hours of 20, or more, varies by programs.*

If you stop attending classes, drop below your required course load, or fail to maintain the minimum number of weekly instructional hours for workshops/clinical placements for your entire study period, but you do not formally withdraw from school, you may still be considered withdrawn for student assistance purposes.

You will be considered withdrawn if:

- You miss two consecutive weeks or 10 instructional days of study (no attendance), or
- You drop below 60% of a full-time course load for three consecutive weeks of study, or
- You miss 20% of the program of study in total, or
- You miss enough classes that school officials feel you cannot successfully complete the program

The college is required to report students' attendance to Student Aid BC and will report the student as withdrawn if the above conditions are met.

If you withdraw from school two times while receiving B.C. student financial assistance, you will be denied further funding by Student Aid BC.
