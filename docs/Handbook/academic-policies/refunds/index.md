Academy of LearningÂ® Career College's policy on withdrawals and refunds adheres strictly to the Bylaws issued by the Private Training Institutions Branch. It is part of your enrolment contract. Your Admissions Representative will review this with you prior to signing your contract.

Students wishing to withdraw from their program must:

- Meet with the Admissions Representative or the Director of the college and
- Submit a letter of withdrawal, delivered personally, by registered mail or by regular mail to the college. This letter is your Official Notice of Withdrawal. Please be advised that the date of program withdrawal will be the date the letter is received by our office, not the date of the letter.
- Please make sure you understand the refund policy. It is your responsibility to ensure you follow the correct procedure if you withdraw. Should you have any questions regarding this policy, please speak to a campus staff member.
- Please note that non-attendance does not constitute Notice of Withdrawal. A student is responsible for all charges up to the time that the school receives an Official Notice of Withdrawal.
- A refund calculation will be processed after receipt of the student's official notice of withdrawal or the college notifies the student regarding their nonattendance and completes the withdrawal process. All refunds are calculated in accordance with provincial regulations. This regulation provides both colleges and students with specific policies on the retention of fees and the payment of refunds. If you have any questions, please speak to the Director at your college.

The student will receive a statement of charges in the mail.
