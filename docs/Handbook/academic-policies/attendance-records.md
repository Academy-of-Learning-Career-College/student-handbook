# Attendance Records
Each day you attend the college, when you come in and when you leave for the day, you must record your attendance on the school's attendance computer located near the reception. You will be shown how to log in and log out on your first day of class. As these records are confidential, you must not share your user identity and password with anyone. For accuracy, please ensure you are assigning your time in class to the course(s) you are working on.

Students found to be logging in for or by another student in the attendance computer will be subject to the following for BOTH students;

- Receive a verbal warning
 - Receive a written warning which will outline future consequences for repeat offenses and be put on Academic Probation
- Be dismissed for subsequent offenses

The attendance records are required for reporting purposes. Please note these records are part of your permanent file and are subject to audit by the government, sponsoring agencies or their designated agents.
