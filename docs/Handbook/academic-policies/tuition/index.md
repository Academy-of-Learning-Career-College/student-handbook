# Tuition Fees and Financial Obligations
Tuition fees include all necessary materials. A payment plan can be arranged to suit students' individual needs. Payments may be made by cheque, credit card, or cash. Fees are charged on a per course basis according to established prices. Total fees are due and payable by the start date unless specific arrangements have been made and recorded on your contract. If you are funded by another organization, we require a letter of authorization. All financial obligations to the school must be met before credit for any courses in the program of study will be given.
