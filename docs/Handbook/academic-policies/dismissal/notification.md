# Notification of Expulsion/Dismissal
Where a student is subject to expulsion/dismissal for any of the above reasons, the student will receive notification in writing, either by hand delivery or by registered mail, with a return receipt to ensure receipt of notification. If the registered mail is returned to the college due to an invalid address provided by the student, the college is not responsible for non-delivery.

The notification of expulsion/dismissal will contain the reason as well as the effective date of the expulsion. If the expelled/dismissed student wishes to dispute the expulsion/dismissal; they must file an appeal within three days in writing to the Franchise Support Centre.

If the appeal is unsuccessful, the student will be considered expelled from the college. The student will have the opportunity for further appeals through the Complaints process of the appropriate provincial Ministry.
