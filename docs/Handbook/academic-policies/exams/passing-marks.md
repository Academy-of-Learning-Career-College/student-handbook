# Exam Passing Marks
Academic requirements for all approved diploma and certificate programs require a minimum final exam mark of 60% in any one subject, while maintaining an overall average of 75%. Students achieving a mark of 90% and higher will pass their course(s) with Honors. A mark below 60% will automatically require a rewrite.

You must ensure that your overall average is acceptable. If your average falls below 75%, you may be asked to stop taking new courses and rewrite exams to bring your average up.

As for individual courses, you must achieve a 75% mark or greater for a single course for an individual Certificate to be awarded.
