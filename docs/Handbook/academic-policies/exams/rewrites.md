# Exam Re-writes

Exam re-writes will only be permitted under the following circumstances:

- If a student enrolled in *individual courses* receives a mark between 60% and 74% on a subject, one rewrite is permitted without charge. After one rewrite, a $30 fee will apply to future rewrites. In any rewrites, the total mark available will be a maximum of 89%. This is because a rewrite is not considered honors.
- If a student enrolled in an *advanced certificate* or *diploma* program has an average below 75%, some exams may be re-written *one time* at no charge.
If a student enrolled in an *advanced certificate* or *diploma* program has an average between 89.10% and 89.40%, some exams may be re-written *one time* at no charge to attain honours on their credential.


Academy of LearningÂ® Career College develops examinations to test the student's knowledge or ability to use the skills they have learned. Should the student fail at the second attempt(s), he/she will need to repeat the course; however, regular fees will apply.
