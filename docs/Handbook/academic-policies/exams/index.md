There are usually two components to exams: A Practical Pre-test which tests your practical knowledge of the course and must be looked at by a Learning Coach before you may proceed. Secondly, an Online Multiple-choice Exam - which tests your theoretical knowledge.

These exams are normally scheduled for the last day of the course. Practical tests must also be completed before the final examination.

Additional in-class tests or quizzes are left to the discretion of the Learning Coach or Instructor. You will receive your results almost immediately, along with feedback on areas that may need further review.

Learning Coach or Instructor will advise you on your exam dates. Depends on the course, if you have completed the study material ahead of schedule, you are encouraged to advise the Learning Coach that you wish to take your exam early.
