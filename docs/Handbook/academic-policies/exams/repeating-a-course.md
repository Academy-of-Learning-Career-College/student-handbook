# Repeating a Course
If you have attained a grade of less than 60% in a course, (marks may vary by registered diploma program and registered certificate program) or you have obtained a credit (60% or more) in every course but do not meet the graduation requirements (average of 75% or more), you may be allowed to repeat a course. It is important to note that the course repeat is a privilege you must earn. Your eligibility is determined at a formal interview with the director of the college.

Where possible, the course to be repeated will be rescheduled after you have completed the balance of your program. The college will make an exception when the course to be repeated is a prerequisite to one or more courses. Please note that there may be a fee for the tuition, course material, and/or the current textbook.

*Please note the minimum grade required for graduation may vary by program.*
