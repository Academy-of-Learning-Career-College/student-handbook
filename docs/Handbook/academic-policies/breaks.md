# Breaks
Students must treat their training as they would an employment situation. As in any job, you are required to "watch the clock" when you take lunch or coffee breaks. A 15-minute, mid-morning or midafternoon coffee break is usually given at work, so get used to this now and ensure you return to class promptly. If a student requires an extended break, he/she must obtain permission from the Learning Coach or Instructor and *must log out* when leaving and log in upon returning to class. If a student fails to notify the college staff, the Learning Coaches or Instructors have the authority to log you out from the attendance computer, or deduct time from your daily attendance, to ensure the accuracy of your attendance records.
