# Student Dress Code
The college seeks to prepare students for the business world. 

While casual dress is acceptable, we encourage students to wear appropriate business attire. 

Unacceptable attire consists of, but is not limited to; ripped clothing, tank tops, midriff baring, flip flops, loungewear, and offensive slogans on shirts. 

The college reserves the right to request any student wearing inappropriate attire to leave the college. The student may return to the college once they are properly attired. 

The determination of 'inappropriate attire' is at the sole discretion of the college. Students will be required to log out of the attendance recorder for this infraction and log back in upon return to the campus.
