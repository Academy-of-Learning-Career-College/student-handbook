# Visitors
A friend or family member(s) may wait in the waiting area, near the entrance, near the end of your study period. 

However, you will be solely responsible for the safety and conduct of the visitor(s) while they are on college premises.  
Permission must be obtained from a college staff to bring a friend or family member to any other areas of the school.  
Visitors are not permitted to attend, observe, spend time (waiting) in classes, or to use any computer facility.
