> *\*Due to the way Microsoft Office is Packaged, we do not recommend purchasing the Home/Student Edition as this will not provide all the programs required for most of our courses*

> *All Current Students of Academy of Learning Career College have access to a free copy Microsoft Office 365 for At Home Learning Purposes*

> *Note: Depending on the courses you are enrolled in, you might be able to use other types of computers. Please speak with Admissions or a Learning Coach before purchasing a computer specifically for school.*
