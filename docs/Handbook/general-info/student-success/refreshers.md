# Refresher Time
As a graduate, you are welcome to re-visit the college to refresh and review the course material, if:

1. You have already passed the course AND
1. We still offer the version of the course you took.

Before your visit, please call us for information and book an appropriate time. You may not be able to book "prime times" for this, but we will be happy to accommodate your needs when possible.
