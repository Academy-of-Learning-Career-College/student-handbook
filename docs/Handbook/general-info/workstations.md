# Workstation Guidelines
We cannot guarantee specific computers or workstations to any students. Your Learning Coach will show you how to operate the equipment in the campus. If you are experiencing problems with the facilities or equipment, please call on campus staff for assistance. Please do not attempt repairs on your own.

Regarding your workstation, please follow these guidelines:

- All media presentation material is copyrighted material and as such cannot be removed from the campus.
- Leave workstations clean and tidy. Allow enough time to tidy up and vacate the workstation for the next student.
- Please logout of your account before leaving for the day. You don't need to shut down the computer.
- Please obtain permission to remain at the workstation beyond your scheduled time. Requests for extra time are usually accommodated; however, relocation to another workstation may be necessary.
- Workstations are booked in 4-hour blocks, the average time for 2 lessons. Should you wish to book additional time, please submit your request a minimum of 1 day prior to the day and time you wish to use the workstation and we will do our best to accommodate the request.
- **Please do not leave personal belongings at the workstation.**
- For the health and safety of our staff and students, please put all outerwear in the designated location and not on the back of a chair as this poses a trip and fall hazard for everyone. As well, please put all purses, backpacks, etc. under the desk to keep the aisles clear.
- Due to the licensing of software, there may be instances when a Learning Coach must relocate a student to another computer. We do our best to minimize this situation because we understand the inconvenience that results, but we ask for your co-operation in these instances.

We reserve the right to inspect, at any time, the computer displays, hard drive, etc., students are using. Such inspections take place only if there is reason to suspect an infraction of the rules. The appropriate officials will investigate the matter and, if circumstances warrant, proceed to investigate all work and files belonging to the student.
