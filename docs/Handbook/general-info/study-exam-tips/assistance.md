# Assistance from Learning Coaches
Our Learning Coaches are always eager to help you.

- Whenever you encounter a problem, first check your understanding of the instructions provided, check your logic and your typed entries. If you can solve your own problem, it will help to building confidence in your own ability.
- If your difficulty persists, please feel free to seek help from any available Learning Coach.
- DO NOT spend an enormous amount of time in attempting to solve a problem without Learning Coach's assistance. Seek help before anxiety sets in.
- Learning Coaches are here to help you, however, please be patient if they are helping another student. DO NOT ASK ANOTHER STUDENT for assistance as each student has timelines and goals to achieve.
- If you have a question that requires assistance for a long period of time, please understand that the Learning Coach may have to excuse themselves to assist another student and then come back to you later.
