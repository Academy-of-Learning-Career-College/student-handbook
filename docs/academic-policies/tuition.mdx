# Tuition Fees and Financial Obligations

### Last Modified: January 1, 2022
Tuition fees include all necessary materials. A payment plan can be arranged to suit students' individual needs. Payments may be made by cheque, credit card, or cash. Fees are charged on a per course basis according to established prices. Total fees are due and payable by the start date unless specific arrangements have been made and recorded on your contract. If you are funded by another organization, we require a letter of authorization. All financial obligations to the school must be met before credit for any courses in the program of study will be given.

## General
The college expects students to pay their tuition according to the arrangements with the Admissions Office and as outlined on the Enrolment Contract.

1. Students are financially responsible for all charges incurred after the Enrolment Contract has been signed. The financial obligations are outlined in the Private Training Act.
1. All fees are payable as specified in the payment schedule as shown in the Enrolment Contract.
1. A fee of $30.00 will be levied for any returned cheques, regardless of the reason it is returned.
1. Academic credits and release of official documents will be withheld until all financial obligations to the college have been met.
1. Some textbooks may not be included in tuition fees, depending on the course. Textbooks will be provided at the start of each course. See also, "Textbooks, Lab Fees and Supplies".

## Tuition Payment, Inquiries and Deferments
Tuition is due according to the terms and conditions of the Student Payment Schedule as outlined on the Enrolment Contract. Students are expected to make payments on time; however, if financial difficulties arise, speak to the Director of the college. Receipts will be provided each time monies are received. (Excludes students funded through a sponsoring agency).

The Campus Director can provide up-to-date and accurate information on tuition accounts. An account statement can be requested at any time. Tuition fees qualify for a federal tax credit. You are also entitled to an educational status credit for each month that you attend. Tuition receipts (T2202) for income tax purposes will be sent to students who have made payments in the previous calendar year. These are generally available in mid to late February. Students funded by a third party will not receive tuition receipts for income tax purposes. (Workers' Compensation, Band, Insurance or Corporate)

Deferment of tuition is generally given to students who have applied for financial assistance through the student loans program but have not received loan documents by the first day of class. Tuition is also deferred for students who have been sponsored by an agency. There is no charge for this deferment.

Students who do not pay fees as agreed or do not make satisfactory arrangements to pay tuition and other charges (lab fees, textbooks, etc.) will be suspended or dismissed.

## Financial Clearance
Graduating students must be in good financial standing before a diploma or certificate is issued. Graduating students should check with the Campus Director/Finance Office when they finish their programs to ensure their account is cleared and/or up to date. If a student's account is not cleared, arrangements must be made with the Campus Director.
