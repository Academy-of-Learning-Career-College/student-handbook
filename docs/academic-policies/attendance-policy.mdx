# Attendance Policy

### Date Last Modified: 2022-01-01
The Academy of LearningÂ® Career College's flexibility allows you to work at your own pace. You may select the hours of attendance that suit your circumstances, but this is subject to workstation availability and within the college's hours of operation. The minimum weekly hours you wish to attend is considered and agreed to at the time of enrollment. However, this is subject to the program's registration as set out by the ministry and your funding source. You may put in additional hours before your end dates providing arrangements have been made to reserve a workstation for this purpose.

No refund of tuition will be given for occasional absences from classes. The student is obligated to complete the program of study within the time frame determined as the end date and the college's guidelines for completing individual courses. During the term of the contract, a student's progress is evaluated, and changes may be considered and recommended to adjust for the pace of the student, and his or her attendance and progress requirements.

Regular attendance is not only a good habit, it is also important in terms of your professional growth. In addition, there is often a direct relationship between regular attendance and academic success. A permanent record of your attendance will be kept.

Please give as much advance notice as you can, if you are unable to attend class. You may be placed on probation or dismissed if there is a record of excessive absenteeism. If you are receiving financial aid, please see the Student Aid BC Loan Requirements section, and Other Funding Sources section for specific details regarding their attendance requirements. We encourage you to clarify any questions with the Admissions Representative at your campus.

## Attendance Records
Each day you attend the college, when you come in and when you leave for the day, you must record your attendance on the school's attendance computer located near the reception. You will be shown how to log in and log out on your first day of class. As these records are confidential, you must not share your user identity and password with anyone. For accuracy, please ensure you are assigning your time in class to the course(s) you are working on.

Students found to be logging in for or by another student in the attendance computer will be subject to the following for BOTH students;

- Receive a verbal warning
 - Receive a written warning which will outline future consequences for repeat offenses and be put on Academic Probation
- Be dismissed for subsequent offenses
:::note
The attendance records are required for reporting purposes. Please note these records are part of your permanent file and are subject to audit by the government, sponsoring agencies or their designated agents.

## Breaks

Students must treat their training as they would an employment situation. As in any job, you are required to "watch the clock" when you take lunch or coffee breaks. A 15-minute, mid-morning or midafternoon coffee break is usually given at work, so get used to this now and ensure you return to class promptly. If a student requires an extended break, he/she must obtain permission from the Learning Coach or Instructor and *must log out* when leaving and log in upon returning to class. If a student fails to notify the college staff, the Learning Coaches or Instructors have the authority to log you out from the attendance computer, or deduct time from your daily attendance, to ensure the accuracy of your attendance records.


## Hours of Attendance
Class hours for Learning Coach or Instructor-led classes will be at the sole discretion of the college. You will be required to attend the classes according to the timetable set by the college. Students are responsible for making up the time they miss, and for arranging to collect any handouts or notes. If you have questions about the hours of operation at your campus, simply ask a Learning Coach.

A student may be placed on probation if the college believes the student has abused any part of the attendance policy. If the problem(s) persists after being placed on probation, a student may be dismissed. A student will be given every chance to remedy his/her situation. A verbal warning and a written warning will be issued before a student is dismissed for a violation of the attendance policy. Please refer to the complete [DISMISSAL/EXPULSION POLICY](dismissal) of this handbook.


## Student Commitment
All students are required to demonstrate a commitment to their studies and to progress at a satisfactory rate. There are minimum standards which all students must meet:

- Meet your minimum weekly hours;
- Complete all assignments, projects, and homework;
- Submit all quizzes, tests, mid-terms and final exams on time;
- Obtain a minimum of 60% in each course; Note: The minimum mark may vary by program.
- Maintain a minimum overall average of 75% in a registered diploma program or registered certificate program; Note: Marks may vary by registered diploma program or registered certificate program
- Obtain a minimum mark of 75% on each individual certificate course.

You can demonstrate commitment in your studies by:

- Attending all scheduled classes;
- Coming to class on time;
- Being prepared (homework or reading may be required depending on the program);
- Being an active student, by listening, doing and completing each task assigned;
- Working on assigned work during class time;
- Participating actively (with a good attitude) in labs, classes and clinical placements;
- Remaining in class for the full, scheduled time each day;
- Seeking help when you need it (e.g. academic, financial and budgeting advice and career guidance); 
- Remaining in good academic standing.

:::note
These are just a few examples. Should you have any concerns about whether you are meeting your obligations, speak to your Learning Coach, Instructor, or director of the college.

## Student Aid BC Loan Requirements
To stay eligible for Student Aid BC loans or grants, you must attend school full-time* for the entire study period for which you have received funding.

:::note
Full-time is at least 60% of the full course load (40% for students with permanent disabilities) for at least 12 consecutive weeks. At AOLCC, it translates to minimum weekly hours of 20, or more, varies by programs.
:::

If you stop attending classes, drop below your required course load, or fail to maintain the minimum number of weekly instructional hours for workshops/clinical placements for your entire study period, but you do not formally withdraw from school, you may still be considered withdrawn for student assistance purposes.

You will be considered withdrawn if:

- You miss two consecutive weeks or 10 instructional days of study (no attendance), or
- You drop below 60% of a full-time course load for three consecutive weeks of study, or
- You miss 20% of the program of study in total, or
- You miss enough classes that school officials feel you cannot successfully complete the program

:::important
The college is required to report students' attendance to Student Aid BC and will report the student as withdrawn if the above conditions are met.
:::

If you withdraw from school two times while receiving B.C. student financial assistance, you will be denied further funding by Student Aid BC.

## Other Funding Sources
Please be advised that every funding agency has their own set of requirements regarding minimum attendance. These requirements will be reviewed with you by your funder and again at the time you enroll. If you do not maintain your attendance, the college is required to advise your funding agency. You may then be assumed to have withdrawn, your program cancelled and may be expected to return all or a portion of your payments. Should you require further clarification, please speak to the Admissions Department or the Campus Director.

The college provides attendance record and progress reports on a periodic basis to sponsoring agencies, if required, on behalf of students. This lets the college, the student, and the agency know if the student is behind or ahead of schedule.

:::note
Attendance and progress records may be subject to scrutiny by sponsoring agencies and are maintained by the college as prescribed.
:::

## Interruption and Resumption of Studies
Any prolonged period of non-attendance from scheduled classes for more than 5 days constitutes an interruption. The college will notify the sponsoring agencies and/or student loan providers after 5 days of absenteeism (or sooner, depending on the agency's policy).

If, for any reason, you must interrupt your studies, but wish to return to them later, please ensure that you follow the appropriate procedure to obtain a leave of absence. Contact the Campus Director at your college for this purpose. Also, please note that an interruption may affect your eligibility for further funding. Check with the Campus Director or your sponsor for more information regarding your interruption of studies.

If you did obtain a leave of absence, and are ready to resume your studies later, you must decide through the Campus Director as soon as you are sure of your return date. Your new start date will depend upon seating and equipment availability.

If a leave of absence was not granted, or you were not in good financial or academic standing at the time you interrupted your studies, you may apply to resume studies by submitting a written request. This written request must explain any reasons and/or mitigating circumstances which prevented you from obtaining a leave of absence. You will be advised of the final decision, and should you be re-admitted, you may be advised of any conditions that you must meet.
