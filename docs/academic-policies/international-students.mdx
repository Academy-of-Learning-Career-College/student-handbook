# International Students

An international student who is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident must obtain an appropriate Study Permit, also referred to as a Student Visa, from their nearest Canadian Consulate, or Immigration Refugee and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) directly as appropriate. In the application to a Canadian Consulate or the IRCC for a Study Permit, the international student applicant will need to include the Designated Learning Institution number (DLI #) on the application form. The applicant will also need a letter of acceptance from the designated learning institution.
