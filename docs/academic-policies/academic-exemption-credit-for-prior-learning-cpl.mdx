# Academic Exemption (Credit for Prior Learning – CPL)
### Date of Last Revision: January 1, 2022

A former student of Academy of Learning® Career College may be able to have credits from a previous course or program they have completed within the last 24 months applied to a new program. All qualified credits will be utilized in shortening the program and the tuition fees accordingly. These credits from a previous program will appear on the new transcript.

CPL may also be granted from other previous and related education, training, and/or work experience. Transcripts, related course outlines, employment portfolios or resumes must be submitted for individual assessment and review, during the admission process. These marks will also appear on the student's Academy of Learning® Career College transcript.

:::note
If the document(s) provided does not contain a grade/percentage, or the level of proficiency cannot be determined, a passing mark of 75% will be given to the course(s) granted CPL. This review is at the sole discretion of the college.

The prospect student may also complete challenge examinations, which indicate acceptable levels of proficiency in specific skill areas. A charge will be applied for these examinations and a score of 75% or greater must be achieved to be considered for the credit. Challenge marks do appear on the student's Academy transcript. No textbooks, workbooks, or notes are issued for courses that were challenged.

Students wishing to enroll in the advanced level of a specific course within a career program must first write the test for the basic level. If the student achieves a passing mark of 75% or more, they may begin the next level of that course. Should the student not achieve a passing grade (75%) on the challenge exam, the course will have to be taken and the regular price.

Credits earned through either prior learning or challenges can qualify for only up to a maximum of 40% of the selected program.

Requests for challenge exams and/or any discussion regarding academic exemption must be arranged and concluded prior to starting classes. Approval for CPL is mandatory prior to the Diploma or Certificate being awarded.

Please discuss this with an Academy of Learning® Career College admissions representative for details.
