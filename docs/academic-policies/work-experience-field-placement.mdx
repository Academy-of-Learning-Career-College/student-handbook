# Work Experience/Field Placement
With the primary exception of a small selection of healthcare programs, Academy of LearningÂ® Career College Diplomas, Certificates and individual courses do not include Work Experience or Field Placement.

Where the college offers programs that include Work Experience or Field Placement, the suitability of the facility is based jointly on the decision of the college Director, Instructors and the suppliers of the specialty portions of the student's enrolled program of study, whose expertise and input is essential for the proper management of this segment of the programs.

Eligible students in healthcare related programs will receive a clinical placement in a "medical/administrative setting". Placements will be made based on the student's choice of program, host availability, and geographic location. Students must be prepared to work shifts and to travel a reasonable distance to their placement site.

:::warning
*Students are responsible for certain forms and activities. When requested, these must be completed without delay, otherwise a placement cannot be guaranteed.*

To ensure that the placement site will provide a relevant work experience for the student, the original agreement outlines what the workplace will provide and what is expected of the student.

A staff person from the college will ensure that the work experience is relevant to the student learning and that the site and its environment are safe.

To participate in a clinical placement is a privilege for a student and there are expectations that appropriate work ethics will always be displayed. Final grading of the work experience is based on the final evaluation by the Host, and is rated as "Pass", "Fail" or "Honours'.
