# Textbooks, Lab Fees and Supplies
All courses are delivered as complete learning packages, including all the required materials. Our student textbooks/manuals/ebooks and corresponding multimedia presentations form the foundation of our learning system. Each multimedia presentation has been prepared with meticulous care in order to act as your Instructor. It carefully coordinates with your textbook and any other course material. Mastering how to follow the multimedia presentation carefully will become the key to your learning success.

All Integrated Learning System&reg; (ILS&reg;) courses, with some exceptions, are supplied with digital ebooks that can be downloaded onto the student's personal devices for reference.
These files are available inside the ILS&reg;.

Optional printed versions are available for a fee. Speak with Admissions for more info,

It is our policy to only issue printed textbooks at the start of the course. This is to ensure students are being issued the latest revision of the textbook.

Printed textbooks become the property of the student once the course of study is made available by the college and issued to the student upon receipt of full payment for the course, except for library copies. Textbooks are the property of the student upon completion of each course. The textbook(s) for each course is supplied at the beginning of each course. Textbooks are not supplied in advance. Textbooks for courses not started will not be issued. The multimedia component, all necessary student data files, and the original software remain the property of LaunchLifeâ„¢ International Inc.

It is our policy to have all your training material ready for you on the first day of the course. Supplies for computer or other specialized labs are provided by the college as you need them and are included in the program lab or material fee.

You will be required to buy general school supplies, such as pens, pencils, notebooks, and USB flash drive (if approved).
