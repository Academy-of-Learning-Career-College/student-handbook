# Student Code of Conduct
We expect mature and professional behavior from our students. All students have the right to a training environment in which they can learn to their maximum potential. Poor behavior on the part of some students will have a negative impact on all students. All Academy of Learning® Career College staff and students deserve to be addressed by others in a respectful manner and tone. Every student is required to respect the policies of the college and the staff members who are required to enforce them. If you feel that you are not being treated in a fair and respectful manner, please feel free to discuss this with a staff member or Campus Director.

We strive to provide more than skills training to our students. We hope that our students will be exposed to all aspects of the workplace, including the requirement of appropriate professional conduct. For these reasons, we reserve the right to start disciplinary action if we deem a student's work ethics or conduct unsatisfactory.

Any student found to have committed any of the following acts of misconduct is subject to disciplinary consequences outlined below. Please note that this list is not all-inclusive but is designed to give an idea of the categories and scope of what may be considered misconduct.

## Appropriate Use of Information Technology
We are committed to ensuring a learning environment in which all persons are treated with respect. Information technology facilities include computers and associated peripherals, means of communication (namely, the internet) and related equipment, facsimile machines, scanners, copiers, telephones, video and other multimedia devices, and all software. Such resources and tools are made available to students in support of their training objectives and academic needs. Use of these resources is governed by codes such as the Criminal Code of Canada.

Every user of this technology assumes the primary responsibility for the material he or she chooses to access, send or display. The facilities may not be used in any manner to create, send or display material which contravenes our policies and/or statutes of the code named above. Personal computers or other devices used on school property, whether owned by the school or by their users, are subject to the abovementioned standards.

Failure to adhere to these guidelines may result in suspension of access privileges as well as other actions as deemed appropriate by the Learning Coach or Instructor and/or director of the college.

Inappropriate use of information technology includes, but is not limited to, the following:

- Unauthorized access, alteration, transfer, destruction, removal and/or disclosure of data, information, equipment, software, or systems;
- Deliberate interference with the processing of a system, or deliberate vandalism of the equipment and/or software;

The possible consequences will depend on the nature and severity of the misconduct. These consequences can range from the loss of privileges, suspension, or expulsion of the student. If provincial or federal laws have been broken, charges will be laid.

## Harassment or Discrimination
If you have good reason to believe you are being harassed:

1. Ask the offender to stop: As harassment is often unintentional, asking to stop the behavior often puts an end to the harassment. The best way to deal with it is to assertively tell the person(s) that their behavior is unwelcome or offensive and must stop.
1. Seek assistance: If the person persists in the behavior that you deem to be harassing, seek assistance by reporting the incident to the Director. Please see the [Preventing and Responding to Sexual Violence and Misconduct Policy](/docs/general-info/health-and-safety/sexual-harrassment)
