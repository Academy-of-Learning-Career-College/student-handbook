# Learning from Home / Hybrid Learning

### Last Modified: 2022-03-01
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Academy of Learning速 Career College has updated its Integrated Learning System速 (ILS速) to allow for Learning from Home and Hybrid Learning. Hybrid Learning is a combination of Learning from Home and Learning on Campus.

The advantage of Learning from Home is that you can access your courses and even the final exams from home using the same myAOLCC Learning Hub that you use at the campus.

Regular attendance is still required. However, Learning from Home allows you to spread your hours across all 7 days instead of just Monday to Friday. And you can work on your courses in the evening, after the kids have gone to bed.

While working from home, you still have the same support that you get at the campus during regular campus hours. If you have any questions outside of the campus hours, you can send an email to your Learning Coach or leave a voicemail, and a qualified learning coach will return your message during the next school day.

:::caution 
Due to technical restrictions, online exams should not be started between the hours of 6:00 PM and 9:00 PM PST
:::

## Software and Hardware Requirements
In order to complete your courses from home, there are certain technical requirements that must be met.
These requirements may change at any point. If you are unsure, please ask your learning coach.

:::note
These requirements are only for Learning from Home. All Academy of Learning速 Career College campuses are equipped with the hardware and software required to complete your courses.
