# Exams
### Last Modified: May 19, 2022

For most courses, there are usually two or more groups of activities that are used to calulate your final mark for that course.
This may include:
- Module quizzes
- Daily Tests
- Written assignments
- Final exams

There are usually two components to final exams: A Practical Pre-test which tests your practical knowledge of the course and must be looked at by a Learning Coach before you may proceed. Secondly, an Online Multiple-choice Exam - which tests your theoretical knowledge.

These exams are normally scheduled for the last day of the course. Practical tests must also be completed before the final examination.

Additional in-class tests or quizzes are left to the discretion of the Learning Coach or Instructor. You will receive your results almost immediately, along with feedback on areas that may need further review.

:::tip
Online Quizzes completed within the myAOLCC learning hub will give you your mark and feedback immediately.
We recommend using this feedback to improve your understanding of the module.
:::

Your Learning Coach or Instructor will advise you on your exam dates. Depending on the course, if you have completed the study material ahead of schedule, you are encouraged to advise the Learning Coach that you wish to take your exam early.

:::tip
Some quizzes and practice exercises are not used to calulate your mark for that course.

## Exam Passing Marks
Academic requirements for all approved diploma and certificate programs require a minimum final mark of 60% in any one subject, while maintaining an overall average of 75%. Students achieving a mark of 90% and higher will pass their course(s) with Honors. A course mark below 60% will automatically require a rewrite.

:::caution
Some program specific courses require a final exam mark of at least 75%. 
A good rule of thunb is, if the Course Code on your Student Record starts with "H", then the course final exam will require a minimum of 75%
:::




You must ensure that your overall average is acceptable. If your average falls below 75%, you may be asked to stop taking new courses and rewrite exams to bring your average up.

As for individual courses, you must achieve a 75% mark or greater for a single course for an individual Certificate to be awarded.

## Repeating a Course
If you have attained a grade of less than 60% in a course, (marks may vary by registered diploma program and registered certificate program) or you have obtained a credit (60% or more) in every course but do not meet the graduation requirements (average of 75% or more), you may be allowed to repeat a course. It is important to note that the course repeat is a privilege you must earn. Your eligibility is determined at a formal interview with the director of the college.

Where possible, the course to be repeated will be rescheduled after you have completed the balance of your program. The college will make an exception when the course to be repeated is a prerequisite to one or more courses. Please note that there may be a fee for the tuition, course material, and/or the current textbook.

:::caution
Please note the minimum grade required for graduation may vary by program.

## Exam Appeal Policy
Academy of Learning® Career College has established an exam appeal procedure for a reassessment of a student's exam. When the Director, Learning Coach or the student queries a question or feels that a question on an exam was marked incorrectly, according to the courseware studied, the Director or Learning Coach, if they agree that the student's claim is legitimate, will submit a Petition to the Help Desk.

Help Desk is a method for college staff to communicate with the Academic Division of LaunchLife™ International Inc. If there is a Petition with any of the Online Multiple-Choice exams, attention is immediately drawn to the problem question. Wording of the question as well as the selection of responses are reviewed and re-assessed. If the Petition is successful, marks are adjusted to compensate the student accordingly. If a Petition is unsuccessful, an explanation will be provided to validate both the question and the correct answer(s).

If a grade appeal is raised by a student enrolled in third-party program, the Learning Coach can contact the Academic Division of LaunchLife™ International Inc. via the Help Desk using the Course Query function. The Academic Division reviews the student's appeal and will direct it to the appropriate third-party provider. Subsequently, the third-party provider will review the appeal, will decide, and will then report back to the Academic Division. The final decision of the grade appeal will be reported back to the Learning Coach by way of the Academic Division.


## Protecting Academic Integrity
All students and staff are responsible for protecting the academic integrity of the college. This is best done through preventing and stopping academic dishonesty. Here are some ways to achieve this:

- Report any irregularities immediately to your Learning Coach or Instructor
- Make it unacceptable and difficult for students to cheat.

Here are a few suggestions:
- Cover your work during exams.
- Give discouraging glances to students trying to cheat.
- Refuse to give away old term papers, assignments, etc.
- Deny others access to your computer files.
- Always try to protect your belongings. Do not leave your work unattended.
